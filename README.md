# E-Commerce Backend

Imagine you work at Amazon. Now imagine having to add, sort and remove the bazillions of products they have by hand, using an Excel spreadsheet. Doesn't sound very fun, does it?

We can harness the power of databases and API routes to do the heavy lifting for us. This repo demonstrates the beginnings of a product-handling system, aka an e-commerce backend. It will find, update, create and delete products, product categories and product tags for you.

## How to use it

Clone this repo and run `npm install` followed by `npm node server.js` in the command line. Then `npm run seed` followed by `npm run start` to seed and start the server. Make sure you've created the database beforehand and added your DB in a .env file.
